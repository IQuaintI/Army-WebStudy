        A Soldier successfully graduates Airborne School and receives "blood
        wings" from the squad. The Soldier is fine with the activity. Does this
        behavior still constitute as hazing?
      </header>
      <p class="answer">
        This is still hazing even if the Soldier agreed to the ritual as it is
        still in violation of Army policy
